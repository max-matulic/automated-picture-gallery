# Automated picture gallery
* As a project assignment I made an automated picture gallery using jQuery.

## ⚙️ Features
* User can use previous and next buttons if he wants to change pictures by himself
* When a user hovers over the picture, automatism stops and the user can rate the images from 1 to 5
* When a user has rated the pictures the grade is printed on the screen
